# THM-Koth
Koth-koth
a repository with cheat-Sheet for Koth in THM (Try hack me)



I made this repository to get cheat-Sheet to play koth lol

my wish is that you only use this repository if it is really necessary (as if you are going to compete with someone who uses autopwn, rootkit or anything else that automates processes, these players are really boring) I do not advise you to use this repository simply to win faster, you wouldn't learn anything from it but that's up to you :)



it is not a step by step on how to finish the machine, but it considerably reduces the work!
